\section*{Question 3}

Suppose vehicles pass a certain point in a highway as a Poisson process with rate 1 per minute.
Suppose \( 5 \% \) of the vehicles are vans.
What is the probability that at least one van passes by during half an hour?
Given that 10 vans passed by in an hour what is the expected number of vehicles to have passed in that hour.
