\section*{Question 4}

Suppose people arrive at a bust stop in accordance with a Poisson process with rate \( \lambda \).
Let \( t \) be some fixed time and suppose the next bus departs at \( t \).
All people who arrive till \( t \) would get on the bus that departs at \( t \).
Let \( X \) denote the total amount of waiting time of all people who got on the bus at \( t \).
(Note that a person who arrived at \( s<t \) would contribute \( t-s \) to the waiting time).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show that \( E[X \mid N(t)]=N(t) \frac{t}{2} \)
    \item Show that \( \operatorname{Var}[X \mid N(t)]=N(t) \frac{t^{2}}{12} \)
    \item Using these two, calculate \( \operatorname{Var}(X) \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}
