\section*{Question 8}

There are three coins in a bag --- one is a fair coin, the second one is a two-headed coin and the third one is a coin whose probability of heads is 0.8.
We pick a coin at random and toss it and it comes up heads.
What is the probability that it is the (i).\ fair coin, (ii).\ it is the two-headed coin?
We toss this coin a second time and it comes up tails.
What is the probability that it is the (i).\ fair coin, (ii).\ it is the two-headed coin?
