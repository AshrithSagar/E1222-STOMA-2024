\section*{Question 4}

A fair dice is rolled twice.
What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers is greater than 7 given that the first dice showed 3?

\subsection*{Solution}

Let \( X_i \) be the outcome of the \( i \)-th dice roll.
Then, the sample space is given by
\begin{align*}
    S & = \{ (X_1, X_2) \mid X_1, X_2 \in \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \}
\end{align*}
Then, we have from Bayes' rule that
\begin{align*}
    P(X_1 + X_2 > 7 \mid X_1 = 3)
     & = \frac
    {P((X_1 + X_2 > 7) \cap (X_1 = 3))}
    {P(X_1 = 3)}
    \\
     & = \frac
    {P(X_1 = 3, X_2 > 4)}
    {P(X_1 = 3)}
    \\
     & = \frac
    {P(X_1 = 3) \cdot P(X_2 > 4)}
    {P(X_1 = 3)}
    \\
     & = P(X_2 > 4)
    \\
     & = \boxed{ \frac{2}{6} }
\end{align*}
