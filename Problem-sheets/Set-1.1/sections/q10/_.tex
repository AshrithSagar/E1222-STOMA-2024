\section*{Question 10}

Let \(A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{n}\) be some events.
Show that
\[
    P\left(\cup_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} P\left(A_{i}\right)
\]
(First show this for \(n=2\) and then use mathematical induction).\\
This is known as the union bound and is a very useful inequality.\\
Also show that
\[
    P\left(\cup_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\right) \geq \sum_{i=1}^{n} P\left(A_{i}\right)-\sum_{i<j} P\left(A_{i} A_{j}\right)
\]
