\section*{Question 7}

Suppose a point is chosen at random from the square \( [-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]\) in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).
What is the probability that the sum of the coordinates of the point is greater than 2?
What is the probability that the point is inside a circle of radius 1.0 with origin as the center?
What is the probability that the point is inside this circle given that the sum of the coordinates of the point is greater than 2.
