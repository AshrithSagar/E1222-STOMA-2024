\section*{Question 5}

A coin, whose probability of heads is \( p \), is tossed repeatedly till we get a head.
Calculate the probability that the number of tosses needed is even.

\subsection*{Solution}

Let \( A \) be the event that the number of tosses needed is even.

Probability of getting a tail is \( (1 - p) \).

\begin{align*}
    P(A)
     & =
    (1 - p)p + {(1 - p)}^3p + {(1 - p)}^5p + \ldots
    \\ & =
    \frac{(1 - p)p}{1 - {(1 - p)}^2}
    =
    \frac{(1 - p)p}{2p - p^2}
    =
    \boxed{
        \frac{1 - p}{2 - p}
    }
\end{align*}
