\section*{Question 6}

Consider all families of exactly three children.
We assume all eight possible geneder configuarations are equally likely.
Let \( A \) be the event that a family has at most one boy and let \( B \) be the event that the family has children of both genders.
Are \( A \) and \( B \) independent?
Suppose we consider families with exactly two children with the four gender configuarations being equally likely.
Let \( A \) and \( B \) be as before.
Are they independent now?
