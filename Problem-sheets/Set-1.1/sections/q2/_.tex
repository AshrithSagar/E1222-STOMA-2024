\section*{Question 2}

A fair coin is tossed \(n\) times.
What is the probability that the difference between the number of heads and the number of tails is equal to \(n - 3\)?

\subsection*{Solution}

Let \(H\) be the number of heads and \(T\) be the number of tails.

\begin{align*}
    H + T & = n               \\
    H - T & = n - 3           \\
    \implies
    H     & = n - \frac{3}{2} \\
    T     & = \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}
which is not possible as \(H\) and \(T\) are integers.

Thus, the \underline{probability is 0}.
