\section*{Question 2}

A fair coin is tossed \(n\) times.
What is the probability that the difference between the number of heads and the number of tails is equal to \(n - 3\)?

\subsection*{Solution}

Let \(H\) be the number of heads and \(T\) be the number of tails.

Then, we have \(H + T = n\) and \(H - T = n - 3\).

Solving them, we get \(H = n - \frac{3}{2}\) and \(T = \frac{3}{2}\), which is not possible as \(H\) and \(T\) are integers.

Thus, the probability is \(\boxed{0}\).
