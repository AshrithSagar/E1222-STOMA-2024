\section*{Question 13}

A coin having probability \( p \) of coming up heads is successively tossed till the \( r^{\text {th }} \) head appears.
( \( p \) and \( r \) are parameters).
Let \( X \) denote the number of tosses needed. Find the mass function of \( X \).
(Hint: To calculate \( P[X=n] \), think of how many heads are allowed in the first \( n-1 \) tosses).
