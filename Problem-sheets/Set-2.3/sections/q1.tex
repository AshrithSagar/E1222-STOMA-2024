\section*{Question 1}

Consider the random experiment of five independent tosses of a fair coin.
In any outcome (of this random experiment) we say a changeover has occurred at the \( i^{\text {th }} \) toss if the result of the \( i^{\text {th }} \) toss differs from that of the \( (i-1)^{\text {th }} \) toss.
Let \( X \) be a random variable whose value is the number of change-overs.
For example, if the outcome of the random experiment is HTTHH then the value of \( X \) would be 2.
Note that the minimum value of \( X \) is 0 (e.g., when the outcome is \( H H H H H \) ) and the maximum value of \( X \) is 4 (e.g., when the outcome is HTHTH).
Find the probability mass function of \( X \).\\
Now, generalize this to the case of \( n \) tosses.
