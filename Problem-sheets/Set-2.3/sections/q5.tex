\section*{Question 5}

Suppose \( X \) is a discrete random variable taking positive integer values.
Assume \( E|X|<\infty \).
Show that
\begin{equation*}
    E[X]=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P[X>k]
\end{equation*}
(Hint: We know that \( P[X>k]=\sum_{j=k+1}^{\infty} P[X=j] \).
So, the RHS above is a double summation and what you need is regrouping of terms in this double summation to make it equal to \( E X \).
First try this for an example random variable that takes only a few values.)
