\section*{Question 4}

Suppose \( X \) is a continuous random variable with \( E|X|<\infty \).
Suppose the density function of \( X \) is symmetric about \( c \).
(That is, \( f_{X}(c-x)= \) \( \left.f_{X}(c+x), \forall x\right) \).
Show that \( E X=c \).
(Hint: Split the \( E X \) integral into two parts: one from \( -\infty \) to \( c \) and the other from \( c \) to \( \infty \).
Use a change of variable: \( y=c-x \) in the first integral and \( y=x-c \) in the second.)
