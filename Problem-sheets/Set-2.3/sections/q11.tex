\section*{Question 11}

If \( X \) has beta density, find \( E X \) and \( E\left[X^{2}\right] \).
(Note that you do not need to do any integrations to find these expectations.
You can obtain them using the form of beta density and the properties of the Gamma function stated in one of the earlier problems).
Using these two, calculate the \( \operatorname{Var}(X) \).
