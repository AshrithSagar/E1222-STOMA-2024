\section*{Question 6}

Let \( X \) be a continuous random variable with \( E|X|^{k}<\infty \) for some \( k>0 \).
Then show that
\begin{equation*}
    n^{k} P[|X|>n] \rightarrow 0 \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty
\end{equation*}
(Hint: Write the expectation integral of \( |X|^{k} \) as two parts one for \( |x| \leq n \) and the other for \( |x|>n \).
Since the integral is finite, argue that the second part goes to zero as \( n \) tends to \( \infty \).
Then try and bound the second integral in terms of \( P[|X|>n] \)).
