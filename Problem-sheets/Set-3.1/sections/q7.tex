\section*{Question 7}

Let
\begin{align*}
    F(x, y)
     & =
    0, \text { if } x<0,
    \text { or } y<0,
    \text { or } x+y<1
    \\ & =
    1, \text { otherwise }
\end{align*}
Show that \( F \) satisfies the following: \( F(-\infty, y)=F(x,-\infty)=0 \); \( F(\infty, \infty)=1 ; F \) is non-decreasing and right continuous in each variable.
Is \( F(x, y) \) a distribution function?

(Hint: If it were the joint distribution of two random variables, \( X, Y \), what would be \( P[1 / 3<X \leq 1,1 / 3<Y \leq 1] \)).
