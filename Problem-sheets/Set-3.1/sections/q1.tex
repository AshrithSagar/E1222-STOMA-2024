\section*{Question 1}

Consider the random experiment of rolling two fair dice.
Let \( X \) denote the maximum of the two numbers and let \( Y \) denote the minimum of the two numbers.
Calculate the joint probability mass function of \( X, Y \) and calculate the marginal mass function of \( X \) and \( Y \) from the joint mass function.
Find the conditional mass function of \( Y \) given \( X \).
