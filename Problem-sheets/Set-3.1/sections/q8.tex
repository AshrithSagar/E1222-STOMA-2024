\section*{Question 8}

Let \( F_{1} \) and \( F_{2} \) be two one dimensional continuous distribution functions with \( f_{1} \) and \( f_{2} \) being the corresponding densities.
Define a function \( f: \Re^{2} \rightarrow \Re \) by
\begin{equation*}
    f(x, y)=f_{1}(x) f_{2}(y)\left[1+\alpha\left(2 F_{1}(x)-1\right)\left(2 F_{2}(y)-1\right)\right]
\end{equation*}
where \( \alpha \) is a real number.
Show that \( f(x, y) \) is a two dimensional density function for all \( \alpha \in(-1,1) \).
Show that the two marginals of \( f(x, y) \) are \( f_{1} \) and \( f_{2} \) (irrespective of the value of \( \alpha \)).

(Hint: Note that when \( F_{1} \) is a df with \( f_{1} \) being the corresponding pdf, we have \[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F_{1}(x) f_{1}(x) d x = \frac{1}{2}{(F_{1}(x))}^{2}\Big|_{-\infty}^{\infty}=\frac{1}{2} \]
