\section*{Question 4}

Suppose \(E\) and \(F\) are mutually exclusive events of a random experiment.
This random experiment is repeated till either \(E\) or \(F\) occurs.
Show that the probability that \(E\) occurs before \(F\) is \( P(E) / (P(E) + P(F)) \).

\subsection*{Solution}

Given \( E \cap F = \phi \).
Taking a similar approach as the previous problem, let us consider the experiment is completed at the end of the \( n \)-th trial.
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{n trials needed})
     & =
    P(\text{n trials needed} | \text{E occurs before F})
    \\ & +
    P(\text{n trials needed} | \text{F occurs before E})
    \\ & =
    {P(E)}^{n-1} \cdot P(F)
    +
    {P(F)}^{n-1} \cdot P(E)
    \\
    \implies
    P(E \text{ occurs before } F)
     & =
    \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} P(\text{E occurs before F} | \text{n trials needed})
    \\ & =
    \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{P(\text{E occurs before F and n trials needed})}{P(\text{n trials needed})}
    \\ & =
    \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{{P(E)}^{n-1} \cdot P(F)}{{P(E)}^{n-1} \cdot P(F) + {P(F)}^{n-1} \cdot P(E)}
\end{align*}
