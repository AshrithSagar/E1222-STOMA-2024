\section*{Question 6}

At a telephone exchange, the probability of receiving \(k\) calls in any time interval of length two minutes is given by the function \(h_2(k)\).
Assume that the event of receiving \(k_1\) calls in a time interval \(I_1\) is independent of the event of receiving \(k_2\) calls in a time interval \(I_2\), for all \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) whenever the intervals \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) do not overlap.
Find an expression for the probability of receiving \(s\) calls in 4 minutes in terms of \(h_2(k)\).
Now suppose \(h_2(k)\) is given by
\[
    h_2(k) = \frac{{(2a)}^k e^{-2a}}{k!}
\]
where \(a > 0\) is some real number.
Now show that the probability of \(s\) calls in 4 minutes is given by \( \frac{(4a)^s e^{-4a}}{s!} \).

\subsection*{Solution}

Poisson process.

Let \( h_4(s) \) denote the probability of receiving \( s \) calls in 4 minutes.
Then, by decomposing \( s \) as \( k \) calls in the first 2 minutes and \( (s-k) \) calls in the next 2 minutes, we get
\begin{equation*}
    \boxed{
        h_4(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{s} h_2(k) \cdot h_2(s-k)
    }
\end{equation*}
Since the independence condition is given, we can express as above.

With \( h_2(k) \) as given above, we have
\begin{align*}
    h_4(s)
     & =
    \sum_{k=0}^{s} \frac{{(2a)}^k e^{-2a}}{k!} \cdot \frac{{(2a)}^{s-k} e^{-2a}}{(s-k)!}
    \\ & =
    {(2a)}^s e^{-4a} \sum_{k=0}^{s} \frac{1}{k! (s-k)!}
    \\ & =
    \frac{{(2a)}^s e^{-4a}}{s!} \sum_{k=0}^{s} \frac{s!}{k! (s-k)!}
    \\ & =
    \frac{{(2a)}^s e^{-4a}}{s!} \sum_{k=0}^{s} \binom{s}{k}
    \\ & =
    \frac{{(2a)}^s e^{-4a}}{s!} \cdot 2^s
\end{align*}
\begin{equation*}
    \therefore
    \boxed{
        h_4(s) = \frac{{(4a)}^s e^{-4a}}{s!}
    }
\end{equation*}
