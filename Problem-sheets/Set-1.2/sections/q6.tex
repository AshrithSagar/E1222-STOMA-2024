\section*{Question 6}

At a telephone exchange, the probability of receiving \(k\) calls in any time interval of length two minutes is given by the function \(h_2(k)\).
Assume that the event of receiving \(k_1\) calls in a time interval \(I_1\) is independent of the event of receiving \(k_2\) calls in a time interval \(I_2\), for all \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) whenever the intervals \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) do not overlap.
Find an expression for the probability of receiving \(s\) calls in 4 minutes in terms of \(h_2(k)\).
Now suppose \(h_2(k)\) is given by
\[
    h_2(k) = \frac{{(2a)}^k e^{-2a}}{k!}
\]
where \(a > 0\) is some real number.
Now show that the probability of \(s\) calls in 4 minutes is given by \( \frac{(4a)^s e^{-4a}}{s!} \).
