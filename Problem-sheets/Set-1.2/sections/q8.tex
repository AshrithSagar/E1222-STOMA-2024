\section*{Question 8}

Suppose there is a TV show like this. There are three closed doors.
The host of the show assures that there is a car behind one of the doors and goats behind the other two.
The contestant has to choose a door and she/he gets the car if the car is behind the door chosen by the contestant.
After the contestant chooses a door, the host opens one of the other two doors and shows that there is a goat behind it and then offers the contestant a chance to change her/his choice to the remaining door.
Should the contestant change her/his choice?

\subsection*{Solution}

The famous Monty Hall Problem.

WLOG, let door 1 be picked by the contestant, and door 2 be the one revealed by the host.
There would be three cases:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-0.5em]
    \item C G G
    \item G C G
    \item G G C
\end{enumerate}
So, in case 2 and 3, it is better to switch, while in case 1, it is better to retain.
Thus, the probability of winning by switching is \( \frac{2}{3} \), which is better.
Thereby, \underline{switching is better}.

There can be more analysis done in this problem, depending on how to \textit{model} the situation, as described in the Hints.
