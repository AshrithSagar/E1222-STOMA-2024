\section*{Question 7}

Suppose \( X \) is a discrete random variable with \( X \in \{0,1,2, \cdots \} \).
Suppose we have \( P[X>m+n]=P[X>m] P[X>n] \) for all non-negative integers \( m, n \).

Show that \( P[X>0] \) is either 0 or 1 and hence argue that we should take \( P[X>0]=1 \).
(Hint: calculate \( P[X>0+0] \) ).

Now show that \( P[X>m]=(P[X>1])^{m} \).
(Hint: \( P[X>m]=P[X> \) \( m-1+1] \) ).

Now show that \( X \) is a geometric random variable by calculating \( P[X= \) \( m \) ].
