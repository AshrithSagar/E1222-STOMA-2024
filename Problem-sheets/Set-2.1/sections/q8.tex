\section*{Question 8}

Consider the probability space with \( \Omega=[0,1] \) and the usual probability assignment (where probability of an interval is the length of the interval).
Define \( X \) by \( X(\omega)=2 \omega \) if \( 0 \leq \omega \leq 0.5 \), and \( X(\omega)=2 \omega-0.5 \) if \( 0.5<\omega \leq 1 \).
What is the event \( [X \in(0.5,0.75)] \)?
Find the distribution function of \( X \).
Is \( X \) a continuous random variable?
