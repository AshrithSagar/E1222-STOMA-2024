\section*{Question 12}

Children from a school went to a picnic in four buses.
Different buses carried different number of students.
Define two random variables, \( X, Y \), as follows.
We select one of the four drivers at random and \( X \) is the number of students in the bus driven by that driver.
We select a student at random and \( Y \) is the number of students in the bus in which the selected student travelled.
Can you say whether \( E X > E Y \) or \( E Y > E X \) (or the information given is not sufficient to decide which of \( E X, E Y \) is greater)?

\subsection*{Solution}
