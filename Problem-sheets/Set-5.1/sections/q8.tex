\section*{Question 8}

Let \( Y_{n} \) be the sum of numbers obtained on \( n \) independent rolls of a fair die, \( n=1,2, \cdots \).
Find
\[
    \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} P\left[Y_{n} \text { is divisible by } 3\right]
\]
(Hint: Think of a 3 -state Markov chain where the state at \( n \) could be the reminder obtained when \( Y_{n} \) is divided by 3).
