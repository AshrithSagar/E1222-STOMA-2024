\section*{Question 4}

Consider a Markov chain on nonnegative integers having transition probabilities, \( P(x, x+1)=p \) and \( P(x, 0)=1-p \) where \( 0<p<1 \).
Show that the chain has unique stationary distribution and find that distribution.

\subsection*{Solution}

The chain is irreducible.

The stationary distribution \( \pi \) if it exists would need to satisfy
\begin{align*}
    \pi(y)
     & =
    \sum_{x} \pi(x) P(x, y)
    \\
    \pi(y)
     & =
    \pi(y-1) p
    \text{ for } y \geq 1
    \\
    \implies
    \pi(y)
     & =
    \pi(0) p^{y}
    \\
    \sum_{y=0}^{\infty} \pi(y)
     & =
    1
    \implies
    \sum_{y=0}^{\infty} \pi(0) p^{y}
    =
    \pi(0) \sum_{y=0}^{\infty} p^{y}
    =
    \pi(0) \frac{1}{1-p}
    =
    1
    \\
    \implies
    \pi(0)
     & =
    1-p
    \\
    \implies
    \pi(y)
     & =
    (1-p) p^{y}
\end{align*}

Hence, the stationary distribution is geometric with parameter \( p \).

Uniqueness requires that the chain is positive recurrent.
