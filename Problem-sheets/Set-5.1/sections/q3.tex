\section*{Question 3}

Consider a Markov chain with the following transition probability matrix:
\[
    P=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0.7 & 0.3 & 0   & 0   & 0   & 0   \\
        0.8 & 0.2 & 0   & 0   & 0   & 0   \\
        0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0   \\
        0   & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0   \\
        0   & 0   & 0   & 0   & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
        0   & 0   & 0   & 0   & 0.5 & 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
Specify which are the transient and recurrent states and find all the closed irreducible subsets of recurrent states.
Find the absorption probabilities from each of the transient states to each of the closed irreducible subsets of recurrent states.
