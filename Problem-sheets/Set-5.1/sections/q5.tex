\section*{Question 5}

A transition probability matrix is called doubly stochastic if both the rows as well as columns sum to one.
Consider a finite irreducible Markov chain whose transition probability matrix is doubly stochastic.
Show that the chain has a unique stationary distribution given by \( \pi(y)=\frac{1}{n}, \forall y \), where \( n \) is the number of states.

\subsection*{Solution}

Since it is a finite irreducible Markov chain, if the stationary distribution \( \pi \) exists, then it is unique.
We can see that \( \pi(y)=\frac{1}{n}, \forall y \) satisfies as a stationary distribution.
