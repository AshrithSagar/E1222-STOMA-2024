\section*{Question 5}

A transition probability matrix is called doubly stochastic if both the rows as well as columns sum to one.
Consider a finite irreducible Markov chain whose transition probability matrix is doubly stochastic.
Show that the chain has a unique stationary distribution given by \( \pi(y)=\frac{1}{n}, \forall y \), where \( n \) is the number of states.
