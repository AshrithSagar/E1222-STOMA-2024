\section*{Question 12}

Suppose that whether or not it rains today depends on the whether or not it rained for the previous three days.
Explain how we can set up a Markov chain model for this.
Suppose that if it rained on each of the previous three days then it will rain today with probability 0.6; if it did not rain on any of the previous three days then it will rain today with probability 0.2; in all other cases the weather today would be same as that of yesterday with probability 0.5.
Now find the transition probability matrix for the chain.
