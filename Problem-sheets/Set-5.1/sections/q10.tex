\section*{Question 10}

Let \( \left \{ X_{n}, n \geq 0\right \} \) be a Markov Chain.
Let \( s_{0}, s_{1}, s_{2} \) be some specific three states.
Suppose the probabilities of transition out of \( s_{0} \) are given by: \( P\left(s_{0}, s_{0}\right)=0.3 ; P\left(s_{0}, s_{1}\right)=0.2 ; P\left(s_{0}, s_{2}\right)=0.5 \).
Suppose the chain is started in \( s_{0} \).
Let \( T \) denote the first time instant when the chain left state \( s_{0} \).
(That is, \( T=\min \left \{ n: n \geq 1, X_{n} \neq s_{0}\right \} \)).
Find the distribution of \( T \) and \( X_{T} \).
