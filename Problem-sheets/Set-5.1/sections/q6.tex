\section*{Question 6}

On a road, three out of every four trucks are followed by a car while only one out of every five cars is followed by a truck.
Find the ratio of trucks to cars on the road.

\subsection*{Solution}

Let the state space be \( S = \{ T, C \} \), where \( T \) denotes a truck and \( C \) denotes a car.
The transition matrix is
\begin{align*}
    P
     & =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1/4 & 3/4 \\
        1/5 & 4/5
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
whose stationary distribution \( \pi \) can be found out by
\begin{align*}
     &
    \pi
    =
    P^T \pi
    \\
    \implies
     &
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -3/4 & 1/5  \\
        3/4  & -1/5
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \pi(T) \\
        \pi(C)
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    \implies
     &
    \pi(T) = 4/15 \pi(C)
    \\
     &
    \pi(T) + \pi(C) = 1
    \\
    \implies
     &
    \boxed{
        \pi(T) = 4/19, \pi(C) = 15/19
    }
\end{align*}
