\section*{Question 2}

Suppose we have two boxes and \( 2 d \) balls, of which \( d \) are black and \( d \) are red.
Initially \( d \) of the balls are placed in box-1 and the remaining in box-2.
At each instant \( n, n=1,2, \cdots \), a ball is chosen at random from each box and the two balls are placed in the opposite boxes.
Let \( X_{0} \) denote number of black balls initially in box-1 and let \( X_{n} \) denote number of black balls in box-1 after the exchange at \( n \), \( n=1,2, \cdots \).
Argue that \( \left \{ X_{n}\right \} \) is a Markov chain.
Find the transition probabilities of the Markov chain \( \left \{ X_{n}\right \} \).
State which are transient states and which are recurrent states.
Is the chain irreducible?
