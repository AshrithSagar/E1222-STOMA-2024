\section*{Question 7}

Let \( X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3} \) be iid Gaussian random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.
Let \( Y_{1}=X_{1}+X_{2}, Y_{2}=X_{1}-X_{2}, Y_{3}=X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3} \).
Find joint density of \( Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3} \).
Are \( Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3} \) independent?
Are \( Y_{2}, Y_{3} \) independent?
