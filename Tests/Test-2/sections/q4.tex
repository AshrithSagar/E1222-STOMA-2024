\section*{Question 4}

A random experiment results in one of \( r \) possible outcomes.
The probability that the \( i^{\text {th }} \) outcome occurs is \( p_{i}, i=1,2, \dots, r \).
(Hence, \( p_{1}+p_{2}+\cdots+p_{r}=1 \)).
Consider \( N \) independent repetitions of this experiment.
Let \( X_{i} \) denote the number of times the \( i^{\text {th }} \) outcome occurs (in the \( N \) repetitions), \( i=1,2, \dots, r \).
Let \( k<r \) be an integer.
Let \( Y=X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{k} \).
Find the mass function of \( Y \) and \( E Y \).
