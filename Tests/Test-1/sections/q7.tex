\section*{Question 7}

Let \(p\) be a number such that \(0<p<1\) and let \(U\) be a random variable which is uniform over (0, 1).
Let \(X\) be defined by
\begin{equation*}
    X = \operatorname{Int} \left( \frac{\log (1-U)}{\log (1-p)} \right) + 1
\end{equation*}
where \(\operatorname{Int}(x)\) is the largest integer smaller than or equal to \(x\).
Find the distribution of \(X\).
