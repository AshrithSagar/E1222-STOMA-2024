\section*{Question 3}

Two numbers are drawn at random from the interval [0, 1].
Find the probability that their sum is less than 1.
What is the probability that their sum is less than 1 given that their product is greater than 0.5?

\subsection*{Solution}

The sample space is the unit square in the Cartesian plane.
The event that the sum is less than 1 is the area of the triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1).
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{Sum} < 1)
     & =
    \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1
    = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    P(\text{Sum} < 1 \mid \text{Product} > 0.5)
     & =
    \boxed{0}
\end{align*}
