\section*{Question 2}

A coin whose probability of heads is \(p\), is tossed repeatedly till we get at least one head and one tail.
Find the probability that \(n\) tosses are needed.
Calculate the probability that the number of tosses needed is even for the case when \(p = 0.5\).

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{align*}
    P(\text{Exactly \(n\) tosses are needed})
     & = P(\text{First \(n-1\) tosses are heads and the \(n\)th toss is tails})
    \\ & +
    P(\text{First \(n-1\) tosses are tails and the \(n\)th toss is heads})
    \\ & =
    \boxed{
    p^{n-1} (1-p) + {(1-p)}^{n-1} p
    }
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{\(n\) is even})
     & =
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} P(\text{Exactly \(2k\) tosses are needed})
    \\ & =
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p^{2k-1} (1-p) + {(1-p)}^{2k-1} p
    \\ & =
    \frac{p(1-p)}{1 - p^2} + \frac{(1-p)p}{1 - {(1-p)}^2}
    \\ & =
    \frac{p}{1 + p} + \frac{1-p}{2 - p}
\end{align*}
For \(p = 0.5\),
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{\(n\) is even})
     & =
    \frac{0.5}{1 + 0.5} + \frac{1-0.5}{2 - 0.5}
    = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{align*}
