\section*{Question 11}

Let \( X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots \) be iid random variables which are all uniform over \( (0,1) \). \\
Let \( Z_{n}={\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right)}^{\frac{1}{n}} \).
Show that \( Z_{n} \xrightarrow{P} c \) and find the constant \( c \).
(Hint: You do not need to compute density of \( Z_{n} \) or its expectation to answer this question).
