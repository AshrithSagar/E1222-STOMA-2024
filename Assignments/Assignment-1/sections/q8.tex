\section*{Question 8}

Let \( X, Y \) be continuous random variables with joint density
\[
    f_{X Y}(x, y)=e^{-x}, 0<y<x<\infty
\]
Let \( Z=X-Y \).
Show that \( Z \) has exponential density and that \( Z \& Y \) are independent.

\subsection*{Solution}

With \( Z=X-Y \), we have
\begin{align*}
    F_{Z}(z)
     &
    = P(Z\leq z)
    = P(X-Y\leq z)
    = P(X\leq Y+z)
    = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{y+z}e^{-x}dx dy
\end{align*}

The marginal density of \( Y \) is given by
\begin{equation*}
    f_{Y}(y)
    =
    \int_{0}^{\infty}f_{X Y}(x, y)dx
    =
    \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}dx
    =
    -e^{-x}\Big|_{0}^{\infty}
    =
    1
\end{equation*}
