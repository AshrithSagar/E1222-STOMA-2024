\section*{Question 6}

Consider the random experiment of repeated independent tosses of a coin whose probability of heads is \( p \).
We say the first run has length \( k \) if the first \( k \) tosses have the same outcome.
We say the second run has length \( k \) if after the first run we have exactly \( k \) consecutive occurrences of the same out come.
(As an example, if the sequence of outcomes observed is HHHTTH \( \cdots \), then the first run has length 3, and the second run has lenth 2).
Let \( Y_{1} \) denote the length of the first run and \( Y_{2} \) denote the length of the second run.
Find the mass function of \( Y_{1} \) and the mass function of \( Y_{2} \).
Show that \( E\left[Y_{1}\right]=p /(1-p)+(1-p) / p \) and \( E\left[Y_{2}\right]=2 \).
