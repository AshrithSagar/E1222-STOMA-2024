\section*{Question 3}

Let \( X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n} \) be random variables with mean zero and variance unity.
Suppose the correlation coefficient of any pair of random variables, \( X_{i} \) and \( X_{j}, i \neq j \), is \( \rho \).
Show that \( \rho \geq \frac{-1}{n-1} \).
Will this result remain true if \( E X_{i}=\mu_{i} \) and \( \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{i}\right)=\sigma_{i}^{2} \); but correlation coefficient between any pair of them is still \( \rho \).

\subsection*{Solution}

In the first case, we have that the mean of each random variable is zero and the variance is unity, i.e., \( E X_{i}=0 \) and \( \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{i}\right)=1, \forall i \).
We have that the correlation coefficient between any pair of random variables, \( X_{i} \) and \( X_{j}, i \neq j \), is \( \rho \).

Consider the variance of the sum of the random variables as follows,
\begin{align*}
    \operatorname{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right)
     & =
    \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{1} + X_{2} + \dots + X_{n}\right)
    \\ & =
    \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{1}\right) + \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{2}\right) + \dots + \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{n}\right)
    + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \operatorname{Cov}\left(X_{i}, X_{j}\right)
    \\ & =
    n + 2 \binom{n}{2} \rho
    =
    n + n(n-1) \rho
    =
    n(1 + (n-1) \rho)
\end{align*}
Now, we can use inequalities.
\begin{align*}
    \operatorname{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right)
     & \geq
    0
    \\ \implies
    n(1 + (n-1) \rho)
     & \geq
    0
    \\ \implies
    1 + (n-1) \rho
     & \geq
    0
    \\ \implies
    (n-1) \rho
     & \geq
    -1
    \\ \implies
    \rho
     & \geq
    \frac{-1}{n-1}
\end{align*}
where the first inequality comes from that the variance of a random variable is non-negative.
