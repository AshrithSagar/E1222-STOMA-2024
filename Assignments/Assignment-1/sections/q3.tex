\section*{Question 3}

Let \( X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n} \) be random variables with mean zero and variance unity.
Suppose the correlation coefficient of any pair of random variables, \( X_{i} \) and \( X_{j}, i \neq j \), is \( \rho \).
Show that \( \rho \geq \frac{-1}{n-1} \).
Will this result remain true if \( E X_{i}=\mu_{i} \) and \( \operatorname{Var}\left(X_{i}\right)=\sigma_{i}^{2} \); but correlation coefficient between any pair of them is still \( \rho \).

\subsection*{Solution}
